.SH PROLOG
Simple man page for sslsniff - ssl monitoring tool, that parse and provides simple information about each ssl connection
Specific implementation details are mentioned below in section
.B DESCRIPTION
.SH NAME
.B sslsniff
\- simple ssl connection monitoring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sslsniff
[\fB\-r\fR \fIFILE\fR]
[\fB\-i\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR]
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 4 
.B sslsniff
\fB\-r\fR \fIseznam.pcapng\fR 
.IP \[bu] 4 
.B sslsniff
\fB\-i\fR \fIany\fR 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS BASIC INFORMATION OUTPUT
<timestamp>,<client IP>,<client PORT>,<server IP>,<bytes>,<SNI>,<packets>,<duration sec>
.IP \[bu] 4 
timestamp is time info from first SYN packet in TCP connection
.IP \[bu] 4 
bytes is total number of bytes from all SSL packets in same connection
.IP \[bu] 4
packets is number of packets in same connection starting from first SYN packet and ending with second FIN packet
.IP \[bu] 4 
duration is difference between time in first packet and time in last packet
.SS ARGUMENTS
.IP \[bu] 4 
If program was started with wrong arguments, program exits with non-zero EXIT code and/or prints basic HELP \n
.IP \[bu] 4 
If parameter <\fB\-r\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR> was given \fB\sslsniff\fR parse given file and prints basic information about SSL connection into STDOUT.
.IP \[bu] 4 
If parameter <\fB-i\fR \fIFILE\fR> was given, program sniffs on live interface, capture, parse and prints basic information about SSL connection into STDOUT
.IP \[bu] 4 
If both arguments were given, parameter <\fB\-r\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR> is preferred
.IP \[bu] 4 
If none arguments were given, program prints simple help and exits with zero return code
.SS CONDITIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE MET TO PRINT SSL CONNECTION
.IP \[bu] 4 
supported link-layer types are \fBANY\fR and \fBETHERNET\fR
.IP \[bu] 4 
connection must be active - to consider connection as an active SSL handshake must have been made (Client hello followed by Server hello)
.IP \[bu] 4 
connection must be properly finished - to consider connection as a finished, packet with FIN flag must have came from one side of connection and packet with FIN and ACK must have came from the other side of connection
.IP \[bu] 4 
connection must contain correct SSL version header - as a correct ssl version header is considered \fBTLS1.0\fR, \fBTLS1.1\fR, \fBTLS1.2\fR and \fBTLS1.3\fR
